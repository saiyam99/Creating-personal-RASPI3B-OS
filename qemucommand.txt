/* 
  following the installion procedure on  
  https://www.qemu.org/download for debian/Ubuntu
  I was able to integrate it to the linux commands without a problem ( NO Problems YET )
  there might be some advantages to getting the QEMU GUI, but for fine tuning settings, terminal QEMU is probably best
  
  This is a one command but it contains a lot of information
  qemu-system-aarch64 in the command to invocate
  THERE IS A LOT OF OPTIONS
  research the OPTIONS, it is used to inform the qemu about specifcs of the board, such as how many CPU core or base memory, or perpherials, etc. 
  disk image is what I'm focusing on as this will be where I will try to modify to the operating system
  
  https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/invocation.html
  Each option is detailed in that link read carefully
