# Creating-personal-RASPI3B-OS-
This is my journal to mark my journey into creating my own operating system specifically aim at my raspberry pi

This repo will be my checkpoint and notepad for my progress


#STAGE 1

First I need to create a suitable platform to test and develop my initial code  
I will be using QEMU to emulation raspberry pi 3 on my Windows 10 computer  
I will be using text files to save powershell commands  
I'm not to experienced in powershell commands
Standards for the text files  
'>' will start a command  
'#' after this, i will note what the command does  
'##' anything extra to keep in mind about this specific text  
'###' 3 means personal details  
'/* */' documents a series of commands before the commands  

Raspberry Pi 3 model has Broadcom BCM2837B0, Cortex-A53 (ARMv8) 64-bit
